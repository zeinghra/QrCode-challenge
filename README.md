## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- VSCode Editor


### What I learned

The easiest way to center a single element vertically and horizontally.

```css
.body {
  min-height:100vh;
  display: grid;
  place-content: center;
}
```

An awesome way to define a perfect ammount of synced border-radius between parent and child element.
```css
.card {
  border-radius: clac(var(--PADDING)+ var(--BORDER-RADIUS-CHILD));
}
```


### Continued development

This is my first time relying heavily on Variables which was very useful.
